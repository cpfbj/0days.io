### Did you know
70% to 90% of all malicious breaches are due to social engineering and phishing attacks?

I always like to think I have a unique approach on cyber security. People are creatures of habits, and when we do the same thing for long enough we eventually become blindsightet. There is no denying it.
I actually believe we spent too much time and effort securing parameters, setting up expensive firewalls, configuring DNS servers, enforcing certain big-branded end-point-detection systems because we've been recommended the brand, but haven't actually tested out.
Don't get me wrong here, I do recommend setting up a good parameter and have high visibility, but when looking at the core value of all these things, and the people behind these systems, I think most companies balance the budget wrong.

Train your staff. Educate your staff. These are the people you trust everyday to not click that tempting link, promising free gift certificates and what not. If we spend hundred of thousands of dollars or even more, setting up defensive parameters, but someone manages to bypass your spamfilter with a mailcannon and spoof the domain name making it highly unlikely your untrained staff will spot anything suspicious, what's the point?
Your staff just clicked the link and submitted their details.

Now you might ask something along the lines of; isn't all of this just speculations? Isn't this all a little exaggerated?

Seriously, no. It is not.
