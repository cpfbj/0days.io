Last night I read about Cialdini's Consistency. To quote Wikipedia, it states:
"The consistency principle states that people are motivated toward cognitive consistency and will change their attitudes, beliefs, perceptions and actions to achieve it. Robert Cialdini and his research team have conducted extensive research into what Cialdini refers to as the 'Consistency Principle of Persuasion'."
Exciting stuff! 

### The Principles of Cialdini

Cialdini found out that influence is based on a six key principles: 

Reciprocity, commitment and consistency, social proof, authority, liking and scarcity.

In 2016 he proposed yet another principle and called it the unity principle. The more we identify ourselves with others, the more we are influenced by these people.


### Turning theory in practice
My ultimate goal was to employees to go to a web page and enter credentials, but I wasn't going to just ask for that. So I asked three simple questions first that I figured would all be good for the user and I praised them each time.
"Hi, this is Frederik, I'm doing the annual security audit where random names are chosen by [insert management name here] and then we just do a quick 2 minute spot check to be sure we are in line with our compliance goals. Can I just ask you the questions I have on my list? The employees are usually always happy to help out and agrees.
Are you careful about what web sites you visit while on your company-issued laptop?
Yes.
Great. Do you still have the Norton Anti-Virus installed, or did you remove it?
I didn't remove it.
Ok, cool. Yeah, some people did, so that's why we ask. We're almost done here.
When you see sketchy emails, do you report those?
Yes.
Oh good, some people said they didn't know what they look like so I then had to explain it to them, but you're doing great work, thank you for that. Last one, the company policy is that all passwords must be at least 8 characters, can you go to this site, enter your password and the next page will confirm whether it complies with policy and just tell me if it does, and then I'll be out of your hair."

Didn't work on the IT people they gave me. Worked great on non-IT people.
