When ever I read articles on database leaks of mostly any kind, there is always one detail that keeps coming back.
And that is, there is almost always somekind of human error involved in a database leak. [According to DLA Piper](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/netherlands/insights/publications/2021/01/dla-piper-gdpr-fines-and-data-breach-survey-2021/), more than 281,000 personal data leaks have been notified by organizations within the EU.
