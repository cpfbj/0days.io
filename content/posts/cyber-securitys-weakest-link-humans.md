When ever I read articles on data leaks of mostly any kind, there is always one detail that keeps coming back.
There is almost always somekind of human error involved in a database leak. [According to DLA Piper](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/netherlands/insights/publications/2021/01/dla-piper-gdpr-fines-and-data-breach-survey-2021/), more than 281,000 personal data leaks have been notified by organizations within the EU.
That raises a question or two in my book - are we aware of our responsibilities and duties as a person dealing with different kind of sensibile data in our daily job? If not, can we simply boil it down and solve the issue?
