When ever I read articles on data leaks of mostly any kind, there is always one detail that keeps coming back.
There is almost always somekind of human error involved in a database leak. [According to DLA Piper](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/netherlands/insights/publications/2021/01/dla-piper-gdpr-fines-and-data-breach-survey-2021/), more than 281,000 personal data leaks have been notified by organizations within the EU.
That raises a question or two in my book - are we aware of our responsibilities and duties as a person dealing with different kind of sensibile data in our daily job? If not, can we simply boil it down and solve the issue?

### Human error causes the most data leaks
Let us not get ahead of ourselfes. If we set up an example that could cause a unnoticed data leak in our daily routine, we should look at emails. If I want to email my colleague Bob the birthday invitation I spend the entire morning working on, but settle in by typing "Bo" and then tabbing it out, I might aswell send it to the most recent recipient starting with "Bo". That could also be "Bon Jovi", who knows?
Now the issue comes into place. I just emailed Bon Jovi my birthday invitation, and I did not even notice. When I meet Bob later by the coffeemachine and asks him to bring a bottle of wine to the birthday party, he would have no clue of what I am talking about. Not until then have I then been able to call the DPO and notify a data leak.
Come to think of it, I would love to have Bon Jovi at my birthday party, but that is not the point.
