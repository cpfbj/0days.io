### Is a number between 1 and 10 enough to rate and determine a vulnerabilities potential in your organization?

Common Vulnerabilitiy Scoring System (CVSS) is a ranking system that is being used as an industry standard for rating a vulnerabilties potential damage on your organization. The numerical score between 1 and 10 can then be translated into a qualitative representation, such as low, medium, high and critical to help organizations properly assess and prioritize the vulnerabilities found in their organization.
Usually the vulnerabilities are found by an automated tool from which within they are ranked based on the CVSS.
The main issue with CVSS is the way people tend to read the results. When we don't look any deeper into the results than the numbers, we become blind of what is really there.
